# Kendama List Application

This application will display kendamas in a Instagram like grid view.

Primarily starting this app to work with WTForms

## User stories

* [x] The main page displays a 3 column grid that displays pictures of kendamas
* [x] Under the image, there is a header with the name and a table with further description, brand, link to buy
* [x] There is a form, that allows me to add a name and link to the kendama picture
* [x] Kendamas can be deleted through a button (individually)
* [ ] There is a tab with instagram tab with the #kendama filter to see kendama posts

## TODOS

* Replace images with shots of your own
* Start looking into Instagram's API 
* Can delete through client side, make change on the backend


## Things I have learned

* using text-center and center-block, to center text and images with bootstrap
* had this problem before where images become pixelated, resize images to 600x350 for a good fit
* how to use pinta, use rectangle select, go to image up top and click crop to selection
* using ajax to do a POST request, thanks to this article http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14908864/how-can-i-use-data-posted-from-ajax-in-flask
